Where I started: I created a React application using Typescript. Then I used my advance folder structure. I also thought about when the project gets big, how I can add router and show header and others. Then I decided to which libraries I need to fetch data, global state controlling, tailwindcss to desing and to test project.

How I continued: I used tailwindcss to implement figma desing to my application with mock data. Then I created a service to fetch data, get filter options and get product id. I also created reducers to show set and get variables to show and render where I need.

How I finished: After I implemented the two pages as expected, I started to respond by phone. Then I manually tested conditions how to answer me. I also tested slices and many other components.
